# CSE423-Project-using-OpenGL-Computer-Graphics-
In this project, we have tried to implement the basics of computer graphics using the mid-point line drawing algorithm and circle drawing algorithm. 
We also used transformation, rotation, and scaling here. 
The concept of our project is a half-filled glass is there. 
We used rotation to rotate the glass and scaling to increase the water level. 
We used mid-point line drawing algorithm for drawing the class and mid-point circle drawing algorithm to draw the water drops. 
Taking user inputs all the actions will take place.
